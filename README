A high-performance subleq interpreter.

Simulates a RISC (OISC, or URISC) processor by interpreting input as operands
to the subleq instruction (subtract and branch if less than or equal to). This
processor is Turing complete.

If you really care about performance and use continuous, similar inputs, you
should use profile-guided optimization when compiling.

Makefile targets:
	subleq
		- Normal usage
	carefree
		- Does not check for errors reading files (useful for multiple
			file inputs)
		- Does not allow '-' for reading from standard input
		- Enables link-time optimization
	debug
		- Generates debug symbols
		- Compiles with warnings
		- Prints warnings if printing or reading fails or could fail
