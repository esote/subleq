A subleq interpreter.

Simulates a RISC (OISC, or URISC) processor by interpreting input as operands
to the subleq instruction (subtract and branch if less than or equal to). This
processor is Turing complete.

If you really care about performance and use continuous, similar inputs, you
should use profile-guided optimization when compiling.
